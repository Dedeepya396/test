## .myshrc
I have done both aliases part and functions part, I am implementing aliases by comparing whether the line contains alias or not and for functions I am doing by comparing the line and `func` word

Aliases I implemented are `reveall`, `home`. Functions I have implemented are `mk_hop`, `hop_seek`.

## Redirection
I am changing file descriptors according to the redirection present in the command, after that I am executing the command checking whether they are user commands or system commands, for system commands I am checking a flag if it is 0 then I will run the command in background process else in foreground process

## Pipes

I am connecting input and outputs of one pipes to another properly and executing command. 

## Pipes and redirection

This code is same as the pipes one but the difference is I call the function for redirection instead of exec

## Activities
I have created a struct `Activities` and I created an array of structs which is a global variable. Whenever I am creating a process, I am adding the details of that process into the array. 
#### Assumption:
Also I am adding both foreground and background processes into the array. For my simplicity in accessing pids of fg processes, I have added them and printing them. Although printing can be done only for fg processes because of the presence of fg_bg flag in the struct only bg can be done but I wanted to see pids of fg processes in other specifications hence I am printing both. 

## Signals

For signals, I am sending the given signal%32 to the given pid, if pid is not present then it will print a statement.
For ctrl z,c I have used `signal()` function and `signal_handler` function.

#### Assumptions

If `sleep x` is running then I press ctrl d, it will not log out of the shell immediately, it will log out after the execution of `sleep x`

## Neonate 
In this I take the input and I will get wait time, Now I will print the pids after every wait_time no of secs. There is a function `is_key_pressed()` which checks whether x is pressed or not. If it is pressed then printing will stop
#### Assumptions
The printing will not stop instantly, if presently wait time is going on. Once that wait_time is done, it will stop. I am checking whether x is pressed before and after waiting

# PART - C

## iMan

In this I create a socket, connect and will send a get Request which is created by observing the url of website. Then I will read the response received, for me, header is ending with `\n\n` although when I asked my friends headers are ending with something else. The part after `\n\n` will be the body, In that I am ignoring contents in `<` and `>`, hence printing only manpage
## Assumptions
I have assumed that every command is separated by a space, for example `hop .. ; sleep 5 & echo hello ;` is considered as a valid command in my shell and not `hop ..;sleep 5&echo hello;`. The same is when both redirection and piping is present
I have declared size of every array I am using as buf_size which is 4096
